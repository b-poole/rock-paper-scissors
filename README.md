# rock-paper-scissors
Rock, Paper, Scissors game created in python. 

_**Usage**_
Open the program, and the computer will choose its hand. You type 'a', 'b', or 'c'. Your hands will be revealed, and a winner will be declared. The program will ask if you want to play again. If not, then your final score will be displayed and you will be asked if you want to record your scores? If so, a scores.json file will be created with your score, and updated each time you play again.

This project was created as a learning experience in logging and file I/O.

When using this program, it will create a scores.json file to keep track of your scores inbetween sessions.

This program will also create a main.log file to keep track of what happens and helps with debugging.
